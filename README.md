# AWS Iot Bridge Example

## Overview
The **`aws_iot_mqtt_bridge`** package contains configuration and launch files to integrate a robot running ROS with AWS IoT by using the **`mqtt_bridge`** package. The mqtt_bridge acts a bridge between ROS systems and servers running the MQTT protocol. For more information please visit the [mqtt_bridge] repository.

**AWS IoT Core Summary**: AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected devices such as sensors, actuators, embedded micro-controllers, or smart appliances and the AWS Cloud. This enables you to collect telemetry data from multiple devices, and store and analyze the data. You can also create applications that enable your users to control these devices from their phones or tablets.

**Features in Active Development**:
- Use the built-in X.509 certificate as the unique device identity to authenticate AWS requests using the ROS AWS cloud service integrations, for more information, please visit [authorizating direct AWS calls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/authorizing-direct-aws.html)

### Supported ROS Distributions
- Kinetic

## Installation

### IoT Device Certificate
You will need to create an AWS Account and configure the credentials to be able to communicate with AWS services. You may find [AWS Configuration and Credential Files] helpful. In addition to AWS credentials to communicate with AWS IoT, you will need to generate an X.509 certificate in order to identify your robot to AWS IoT Core. For more information, please visit [managing device certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/managing-device-certs.html).

### Binaries
On Ubuntu you can install the latest version of this package using the following command

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y ros-kinetic-iot-bridge

### Building from Source

To build from source you'll need to create a new workspace, clone and checkout the latest release branch of this repository, install all the dependencies, and compile. If you need the latest development features you can clone from the `master` branch instead of the latest release branch. While we guarantee the release branches are stable, __the `master` should be considered to have an unstable build__ due to ongoing development. 

- Create a ROS workspace and a source directory

    mkdir -p ~/ros-workspace/src

- Clone the package into the source directory . 

_Note: Replace __`{MAJOR.VERSION}`__ below with the latest major version number to get the latest release branch._

        cd ~/ros-workspace/src
        git clone https://github.com/aws-robotics/aws-iot-bridge-example.git -b release-v{MAJOR.VERSION}

- Install dependencies

        cd ~/ros-workspace 
        sudo apt-get update && rosdep update
        rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
        
_Note: If building the master branch instead of a release branch you may need to also checkout and build the master branches of the packages this package depends on._

- Build the packages

        cd ~/ros-workspace && colcon build

- Configure ROS library Path

        source ~/ros-workspace/install/setup.bash



## Launch Files
An example launch file called `aws_iot_bridge.launch` is provided, however the launch file cannot work without proper configuration. Since AWS IoT uses unique endpoints and certificates for each account and device, you must first discover your AWS IoT endpoint and generate a certificate before you can connect.

## Usage

### Run the node
- **With** launch file using parameters in .yaml format (need to be configured first)
  - ROS: `roslaunch aws_iot_mqtt_bridge aws_iot_bridge.launch bridge_params:=config/example_aws_iot_params.yaml`

- **Without** launch file using default values
  - ROS: `rosrun mqtt_bridge mqtt_bridge_node.py`

### Verify topics are publishing
- Go to your AWS account
- Find AWS IoT Core
- On the upper right corner, change region to `Oregon` if you launched the node using the launch file, or change to `N. Virginia` if you launched the node without using the launch file
- Select `Test` from the menu on the left side of the screen
- Type the name of one of the configured topics and click `Subscribe to topic`
- You should see messages begin appearing in the bottom half of the screen

## Configuration File and Parameters
An example configuration file called `example_aws_iot_params.yaml` is provided. When the parameters are absent in the ROS parameter server, the mqtt_bridge will use defaults, please refer to the [mqtt_bridge] package.

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Allowed Values |

| tls/tls_version | Protocol version to use when connecting to AWS TLS endpoint (5 is TLS1.2) | *int* | A valid python [TLS protocol](https://docs.python.org/2/library/ssl.html) |
| tls/tls_insecure | Indicator if certificates validation should be disabled, defaults to false  | *bool* | *bool* |
| connection/host | Host name of the AWS endpoint to connect | *std::string* | A valid DNS name or IP address |
| connection/port | Port to use when connecting to AWS IoT core (default is 8883) | *int* | A valid port number (1-65535) |
